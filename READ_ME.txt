Multi layer neural network with with backpropogation.

For this moment, full batch learning is available and 0 or 1 hidden layer.

Constructor takes such parameters as:
- data set (np.ndarray); 
- input vector length (int); 
- hidden layers. List with integers. [0] - if there is no hidden layers;
- targets. List of classes;


To be done:
- online learning;
- mini-batch learning;
